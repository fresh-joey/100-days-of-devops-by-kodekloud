# Day 44: Write a Docker Compose File

## Requirements
The Nautilus application development team shared static website content that needs to be hosted on the httpd web server using a containerised platform. The team has shared details with the DevOps team, and we need to set up an environment according to those guidelines. Below are the details:

a. On App Server 3 in Stratos DC create a container named httpd using a docker compose file /opt/docker/docker-compose.yml (please use the exact name for file).

b. Use httpd (preferably latest tag) image for container and make sure container is named as httpd; you can use any name for service.

c. Map 80 number port of container with port 8082 of docker host.

d. Map container's /usr/local/apache2/htdocs volume with /opt/dba volume of docker host which is already there. (please do not modify any data within these locations).

## Steps
- SSH into App server 3
- Create Docker Compose file in the specified directory and include the content below
  ```ini
  services:
  web:
    image: httpd:latest
    container_name: httpd
    ports:
      - "8082:80"
    volumes:
      - /opt/dba:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs
  ```
- Verify the configuration
  ```console
  docker compose config
  yamllint docker-compose.yml
  ```
- Spin up the container to test the configuration
  ```console
  docker compose up -d
  ```


## üìù Notes
- Discovered `yamllint` to help check the exact line with issues in a yaml file. Can be installed with most package managers.
- Ensure the port values are in quotes
