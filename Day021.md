# Day 21: Set Up Git Repository on Storage Server

## Requirements
The Nautilus development team has provided requirements to the DevOps team for a new application development project, specifically requesting the establishment of a Git repository. Follow the instructions below to create the Git repository on the Storage server in the Stratos DC:

Utilize yum to install the git package on the Storage Server.

Create a bare repository named /opt/games.git (ensure exact name usage).

## Steps
- SSH into the storage server
- Install Git
  ```console
  sudo yum install git
  ```
- Create the directory
  ```console
  sudo mkdir /opt/games.git
  ```
- Change into it and initialise a bare repository
  ```console
  cd /opt/games.git
  git init --bare
  ```

## üìù Notes
- Make sure you don't use ordinary `git init`
- It was stated that it is a bare repo that is needed.
