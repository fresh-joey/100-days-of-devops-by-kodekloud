# Day 19: Install and Configure Web Application

## Requirements

xFusionCorp Industries is planning to host two static websites on their infra in Stratos Datacenter. The development of these websites is still in-progress, but we want to get the servers ready. Please perform the following steps to accomplish the task:

a. Install httpd package and dependencies on app server 2.

b. Apache should serve on port 3000.

c. There are two website's backups /home/thor/blog and /home/thor/demo on jump_host. Set them up on Apache in a way that blog should work on the link http://localhost:3000/blog/ and demo should work on link http://localhost:3000/demo/ on the mentioned app server.

d. Once configured you should be able to access the website using curl command on the respective app server, i.e curl http://localhost:3000/blog/ and curl http://localhost:3000/demo/

## Steps
- SSH into App server 2
- Install httpd
- Configure it to listen on port 3000. Edit the `httpd.conf` file
- Copy the website folder from Jump Host with `scp`
- Create a conf file for the websites. `sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/blog.conf` and add the content below
  ```console
  <VirtualHost *:3000>
    DocumentRoot "/var/www"

    Alias /blog /var/www/blog
    <Directory "/var/www/blog">
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    Alias /demo /var/www/demo
    <Directory "/var/www/demo">
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
  </VirtualHost>
  ```
- Restart the httpd server


## üìù Notes
Ensure the proper file path is set in the document root of the configurations \ 
Give proper permissions to the Apache user on the website folders \ 
On CentOS, the Apache user is `apache`, while it is `www-data` on Ubuntu
