# Day 14: Linux Process Troubleshooting

## Requirements
The production support team of xFusionCorp Industries has deployed some of the latest monitoring tools to keep an eye on every service, application, etc. running on the systems. One of the monitoring systems reported about Apache service unavailability on one of the app servers in Stratos DC.

Identify the faulty app host and fix the issue. Make sure Apache service is up and running on all app hosts. They might not have hosted any code yet on these servers, so you don‚Äôt need to worry if Apache isn‚Äôt serving any pages. Just make sure the service is up and running. Also, make sure Apache is running on port 8089 on all app servers.

## Steps
- Check which of the servers has the fault, by running the command on all the App servers
  ```console
  curl -I stapp01:8089
  ```
- App Server One returned a connection refused, which shows that it has issues
- SSH into appserver 1
- Check the status of the Apache server.
  ```console
  sudo systemctl status httpd
  ```
- Enable and restart the service. Unable to start because the port is already in use
- Find the process using the port
  ```console
  sudo netstat -tulnp
  ```
- Kill the process with the PID
  ```console
  sudo kill -9 <PID>
  ```
- Restart the Apache server
- Exit Appserver 1 and test the connection from the Jump Host.

## üìù Notes

These kind of fault happen, that is why it is essential to always monitor services
