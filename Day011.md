# Day 11: Install and Configure Tomcat Server

## Requirements

The Nautilus application development team recently finished the beta version of one of their Java-based applications, which they are planning to deploy on one of the app servers in Stratos DC. After an internal team meeting, they have decided to use the Tomcat application server. Based on the requirements mentioned below, complete the task:

a. Install tomcat server on App Server 1.

b. Configure it to run on port 8088.

c. There is a ROOT.war file on Jump host at location /tmp.

Deploy it on this tomcat server and make sure the webpage works directly on base URL i.e curl http://stapp01:8088

## Steps
- SSH into App server 1
- Install Tomcat on the server
  ```console
  sudo dnf install tomcat
  ```
- Configure Tomcat to run on port 8088
  ```console
  sudo vi /etc/tomcat/server.xml
  ```
- Restart the Tomcat server and check the status
  ```console
  sudo systemctl restart tomcat
  sudo systemctl status tomcat
  ```
- copy .war file from Jump host to App server 1
```console
  scp /tmp/ROOT.war tony@stapp01:/tmp/
```
- SSH into app server 1 to check the file
- Move it to Tomcat server folder
```console  
  sudo mv /tmp/ROOT.war /usr/share/tomcat/webapps
```
- Restart the Tomcat server and check the status
- Verify the WebApp
```console
  curl http://stapp01:8088
```
- It should show the content of the Webapp
