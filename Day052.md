# Day 52: Revert Deployment to Previous Version in Kubernetes

## Requirements
Earlier today, the Nautilus DevOps team deployed a new release for an application. However, a customer has reported a bug related to this recent release. Consequently, the team aims to revert to the previous version.

There exists a deployment named nginx-deployment; initiate a rollback to the previous revision.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is configured to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.

## Steps
- Verify the deployment history
  ```console
  kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
  ```
- Roll back to the previous revision
  ```console
  kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment
  ```
- Monitor the progress of the rollback
  ```console
  kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
  ```
- Verify that pods are working

## üìù Notes
- verify that the image has changed before and after the rollback
