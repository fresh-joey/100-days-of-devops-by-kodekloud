# Day 34: Git Hook

## Requirements
The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /opt/beta.git which is cloned under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos directory present on Storage server in Stratos DC. The team want to setup a hook on this repository, please find below more details:

Merge the feature branch into the master branch`, but before pushing your changes complete below point.

Create a post-update hook in this git repository so that whenever any changes are pushed to the master branch, it creates a release tag with name release-2023-06-15, where 2023-06-15 is supposed to be the current date. For example if today is 20th June, 2023 then the release tag must be release-2023-06-20. Make sure you test the hook at least once and create a release tag for today's release.

Finally remember to push your changes.

## Steps
- SSH into the storage server
- Change to repo folder
- Switch to master branch
- Merge feature branch into master
- Change to the hooks folder
- Create a `post-update` file and make it executable, put the content below
  ```ini
  #!/bin/bash

  BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
  
  if [ "$BRANCH" == "master" ]; then
      TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
      git tag "release-${TODAY}"
  fi
  ```
-  

## üìù Notes
- Hooks only work from the remote repo
- You need to create the post-update hook in the bare repository at `/opt/news.git`
- That is the only time it'll work
- If the repo is on GitHub or GitLab, you will need to implement it with a workflow
