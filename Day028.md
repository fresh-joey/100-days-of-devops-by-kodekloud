# Day 28: Git Cherry Pick

## Requirements

The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/media.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with the DevOps team:

There are two branches in this repository, master and feature. One of the developers is working on the feature branch and their work is still in progress, however they want to merge one of the commits from the feature branch to the master branch, the message for the commit that needs to be merged into master is Update info.txt. Accomplish this task for them, also remember to push your changes eventually.

## Steps
- SSH into the server
- On the Feature branch, check the log to see the hash of the commit. Copy the hash value of the specific commit
- Switch to master branch
- Cherry-pick the specific commit to the master branch
  ```console
  git cherry-pick <commit hash>
  ```
- Push to remote

## üìù Notes
- Cherry picking is only useful when you want to add a specific commit to a branch
- Make sure you copy the hash for the right commit before adding it to another branch
