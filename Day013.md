# Day 13: IPtables Installation And Configuration

## üóìÔ∏è Date: 31st July 2025

## Requirements
We have one of our websites up and running on our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos DC. Our security team has raised a concern that right now Apache‚Äôs port i.e `8086` is open for all since there is no firewall installed on these hosts. So we have decided to add some security layer for these hosts and after discussions and recommendations, we have come up with the following requirements:

1. Install iptables and all its dependencies on each app host.

2. Block incoming port `8086` on all apps for everyone except for the LBR host.

3. Make sure the rules remain, even after a system reboot.

## Steps

- SSH into App server 1
- Install IP tables
  ```console
  sudo dnf install iptables-services iptables-utils
  ```
- Enable and start the service
  ```console
  sudo systemctl enable iptables
  sudo systemctl start iptables
  ```
- Configure IP tables rules
  ```console
  # Flush existing rules
  sudo iptables -F
  
  # Allow port 8086 from the LBR host only
  sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 192.168.1.100 --dport 8086 -j ACCEPT
  
  # Block all other traffic to port 8086
  sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8086 -j DROP
  ```
- Save the rules to persist across server reboots
  ```console
  sudo service iptables save
  sudo systemctl enable iptables
  ```
- Check the configuration to confirm it's valid
  ```console
  sudo iptables -L -n -v
  ```
- Repeat the steps across all the other servers
