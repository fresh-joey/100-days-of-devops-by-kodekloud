# Day 15: Setup SSL for Nginx

## Requirements
The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries needs to deploy a new application on App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter. They have some pre-requites to get ready that server for application deployment. Prepare the server as per requirements shared below:

1. Install and configure nginx on App Server 2.

2. On App Server 2 there is a self signed SSL certificate and key present at location `/tmp/nautilus.crt` and `/tmp/nautilus.key`. Move them to some appropriate location and deploy the same in Nginx.

3. Create an index.html file with content Welcome! under Nginx document root.

4. For final testing try to access the App Server 2 link (either hostname or IP) from jump host using curl command. For example `curl -Ik https://<app-server-ip>/`

## Steps
- SSH into Appserver 2
- Install Nginx
  ```console
  sudo dnf install nginx
  ```
- Enable and start Nginx
  ```console
  sudo systemctl enable nginx
  sudo systemctl start nginx
- Move the SSL certificate and key to the ssl folder
  ```console
  sudo mv /tmp/nautilus.crt /etc/ssl/certs/
  sudo mv /tmp/nautilus.key /etc/ssl/certs/
  ```
- Edit the Nginx configuration file to use the SSL certificates on the server
  ```console
  sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  ```
- Uncomment the TLS configuration block and point the SSL certificate and key to the path where the key and certificate were moved to
- Create an index.html file inside the Nginx document root
  ```console
  sudo touch /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
  ```
- Exit the App server and test the connection from the Jump Host
  ```console
  curl -Ik https://stapp02
  ```
- You should see a successful message like this
  ```ini
  HTTP/2 200 
  server: nginx/1.20.1

## üìù Notes
The document root varies for different distros of Linux
For CentOS it is /usr/share/nginx/html
For Debian/Ubuntu it is /var/www/html
