# Day 25: Git Merge Branches

## Requirements
The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/games.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:

Create a new branch xfusion in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games repo from master and copy the /tmp/index.html file (present on storage server itself) into the repo. Further, add/commit this file in the new branch and merge back that branch into master branch. Finally, push the changes to the origin for both of the branches.

## Steps
- SSH into the storage server
- Change directory to the project repo
- Create a new branch `xfusion` and switch to it
  ```console
  git checkout -b xfusion
  ```
- Copy the index.html file into the branch
- Add and commit the new file to the branch
- Push new branch to remote
- Checkout to the master branch
- Merge the new branch into it
  ```console
  git merge xfusion
  ```

## üìù Notes
- Check the branch you're in before merging to avoid messing up the whole repository
