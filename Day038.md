# Day 38: Pull Docker Image

## Requirements
Nautilus project developers are planning to start testing on a new project. As per their meeting with the DevOps team, they want to test containerized environment application features. As per details shared with DevOps team, we need to accomplish the following task:

a. Pull busybox:musl image on App Server 2 in Stratos DC and re-tag (create new tag) this image as busybox:media.

## Steps
- SSH into App server 2
- Pull the image
  ```console
  docker pull busybox:musl
  ```
- Tag the image pulled
  ```console
  docker image tag busybox:musl busybox:media
  ```
- Verify the new tag

## üìù Notes
- Using `docker image tag` will show the syntax needed to tag the image.
- Tagging an image will only create a new tag; the old one will still be there
- Be sure to clean up regularly to prevent unnecessary images on the server
