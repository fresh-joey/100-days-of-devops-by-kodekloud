# Day 17: Install and Configure PostgreSQL

## Requirements
The Nautilus application development team has shared that they are planning to deploy one newly developed application on Nautilus infra in Stratos DC. The application uses PostgreSQL database, so as a pre-requisite we need to set up PostgreSQL database server as per requirements shared below:

PostgreSQL database server is already installed on the Nautilus database server.

a. Create a database user kodekloud_aim and set its password to dCV3szSGNA.

b. Create a database kodekloud_db8 and grant full permissions to user kodekloud_aim on this database.

Note: Please do not try to restart the PostgreSQL server service.

## Steps
- SSH into the Database Server
- Login to the Postgres Database
  ```console
  psql -U postgres
  ```
- Create a Database User
  ```console
  CREATE USER your_new_username WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'your_password';
  ```
- Create a Database
  ```console
  CREATE DATABASE <db_name>
  ```
- Give full access to the user on the database
  ```console
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE kodekloud_db8 TO kodekloud_aim;
  ```
- Exit server


## üìù Notes
Ensure the Database and User are created before granting privileges
