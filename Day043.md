# Day 43: Docker Ports Mapping

## Requirements
The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to host an application on a nginx-based container. There are number of tickets already been created for similar tasks. One of the tickets has been assigned to set up a nginx container on Application Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter. Please perform the task as per details mentioned below:

a. Pull nginx:alpine docker image on Application Server 1.

b. Create a container named games using the image you pulled.

c. Map host port 6200 to container port 80. Please keep the container in running state.

## Steps
- SSH into App server 1
- Pull image from Docker
  ```console
  docker pull nginx:alpine
  ```
- Create a container from the image pulled
  ```console
  docker run -d --name games -p 6200:80 nginx:alpine
  ```

## 📝 Notes
- Make sure the container is in a running state
- Check to verify the details of the container are correct
