# Day 12: Linux Network Services

## Requirements
Our monitoring tool has reported an issue in the Stratos Datacenter. One of our app servers has an issue, as its Apache service is not reachable on port 5001 (which is the Apache port). The service itself could be down, the firewall could be at fault, or something else could be causing the issue.

Use tools like Telnet, Netstat, etc., to identify and resolve the issue. Also, make sure Apache is reachable from the jump host without compromising any security settings.

Once fixed, you can test it using the same command, curl http://stapp01:5001, from the jump host.

## Steps
- SSH into APP server 1
- Check the status of the Apache service on the server
  ```console
  sudo systemctl status httpd
  ```
- Apache is not running, with the error that port 5001 is already in use.
- Check the network for the process using the Apache port 5001
  ```console
  sudo netstat -tuln
  ```
- Find the process with the port number 5001 and kill the process with the PID
  ```console
  sudo kill -9 <PID>
  ```
- Restart the server and check the status.
- Exit App server 1 and test the connection with the curl from the jump host
  ```console
  curl http://stapp01:5001
  ```
- If the connection fails, check the firewall configuration of App Server 1
  ```comsole
  sudo iptables -L -n
  ```
- Add the Apache port to the IP tables to allow incoming requests
  ```console
  sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 5001 -j ACCEPT
  ```
- The test will be successful now.

## üìù Notes
- To make the rule permanent
  ```console
  sudo iptables-save | sudo tee /etc/sysconfig/iptables
  ```
- Enable the service
  ```console
  sudo systemctl enable iptables
  ```
