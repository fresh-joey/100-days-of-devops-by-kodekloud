# Day 26: Git Manage Remotes

## Requirements
The xFusionCorp development team added updates to the project that is maintained under /opt/apps.git repo and cloned under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps. Recently some changes were made on Git server that is hosted on Storage server in Stratos DC. The DevOps team added some new Git remotes, so we need to update remote on /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps repository as per details mentioned below:

a. In /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps repo add a new remote dev_apps and point it to /opt/xfusioncorp_apps.git repository.

b. There is a file /tmp/index.html on same server; copy this file to the repo and add/commit to master branch.

c. Finally push master branch to this new remote origin.

## Steps
- SSH into the storage server
- Change directory to the repository
- Add a new remote and point it to the repository
  ```console
  git remote add dev_apps /opt/xfusioncorp_apps.git/
  ```
- Copy the index.html file to the branch
- Add and commit the file to the master branch
- Push the master branch to the new origin
  ```console
  git push dev_apps master
  ```


## üìù Notes
- After adding the new origin, check to make sure it was created.
