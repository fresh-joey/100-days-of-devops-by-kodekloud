# Day 24: Git Create Branches

## Requirements
Nautilus developers are actively working on one of the project repositories, /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/official. Recently, they decided to implement some new features in the application, and they want to maintain those new changes in a separate branch. Below are the requirements that have been shared with the DevOps team:

On Storage server in Stratos DC create a new branch xfusioncorp_official from master branch in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/official git repo.

Please do not try to make any changes in the code.

## Steps

- SSH into the storage server
- Switch to master branch
  ```console
  git checkout master
  ```
- Create a new branch from the master branch
  ```console
  git checkout -b xfusioncorp_official
  ```
- Check the list of branches to verify the new branch was created.

## üìù Notes
- The instruction was to create the new branch from the master branch
- That means it should have the same content as the master branch
- That is why you need to switch to the master branch first.
