# Day 27: Git Revert Some Changes

## Requirements
The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster present on Storage server in Stratos DC. However, they reported an issue with the recent commits being pushed to this repo. They have asked the DevOps team to revert repo HEAD to last commit. Below are more details about the task:

In /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster git repository, revert the latest commit ( HEAD ) to the previous commit (JFYI the previous commit hash should be with initial commit message ).

Use revert cluster message (please use all small letters for commit message) for the new revert commit.

## Steps
- SSH into the storage server
- Revert the commit
```console
  git revert HEAD --no-edit
```
- Commit and push changes
  ```console
  git commit --amend -m "revert games"
  git push origin master
  ```
- 

## 📝 Notes
- Ensure you use the --amend flag in the commit command
- It is to ensure that the message is what is specified.
