# Day 51: Execute Rolling Updates in Kubernetes

## Requirements
An application currently running on the Kubernetes cluster employs the nginx web server. The Nautilus application development team has introduced some recent changes that need deployment. They've crafted an image nginx:1.19 with the latest updates.

Execute a rolling update for this application, integrating the nginx:1.19 image. The deployment is named nginx-deployment.

Ensure all pods are operational post-update.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is set up to operate with the Kubernetes cluster

## Steps

- Verify current deployment and pods
  ```console
  kubectl get deployments
  kubectl get pods
- Get the container name
  ```console

  kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[*].name}'
  ```
- Update the deployment image
  ```console
  kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx-container=nginx:1.19
  ```
- Verify the rollout status
  ```console
  kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
  ```
- Verify that all pods are running. The pods should be in a running state
  ```console
  kubectl get pods
  ```
- Verify that the image has been updated
  ```console
  kubectl get deployments nginx-deployment | grep -i "image"
  ```
  
## üìù Notes

- The image should be the updated version
- You need to get the container name to be used to update the deployment image, don't use the pod name for it.
