# Day 47: Docker Python App

## Requirements
A python app needed to be Dockerized, and then it needs to be deployed on App Server 2. We have already copied a requirements.txt file (having the app dependencies) under /python_app/src/ directory on App Server 2. Further complete this task as per details mentioned below:

Create a Dockerfile under `/python_app` directory:

Use any python image as the base image.
Install the dependencies using `requirements.txt` file.
Expose the port 5004.
Run the server.py script using CMD.

Build an image named `nautilus/python-app` using this Dockerfile.

Once image is built, create a container named `pythonapp_nautilus`:

Map port 5004 of the container to the host port 8098.

Once deployed, you can test the app using curl command on App Server 2.


## Steps
- SSH into App server 2
- Change directory to required folder and create a Dockerfile with the content below
  ```ini
  FROM python:3.9-slim

  WORKDIR /app
  
  COPY src/requirements.txt .
  
  RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
  
  copy src/ .
  
  EXPOSE 5004
  
  CMD ["python", "server.py"]
  ```
- Build Docker Image
  ```console
  docker build -t nautilus/python-app .
  ```
- Create and run container from the image
  ```console
  docker run -d --name pythonapp_nautilus -p 8098:5004 nautilus/python-app
  ```
- Verify that the App is reachable
  ```console
  curl http://localhost:8098
  ```


## üìù Notes
- Ensure the container is in a running state
- Ensure the container is named appropriately
