# Day 42: Create a Docker Network

## Requirements
The Nautilus DevOps team needs to set up several docker environments for different applications. One of the team members has been assigned a ticket where he has been asked to create some docker networks to be used later. Complete the task based on the following ticket description:

a. Create a docker network named as official on App Server 1 in Stratos DC.

b. Configure it to use macvlan drivers.

c. Set it to use subnet `172.28.0.0/24` and iprange `172.28.0.0/24`.

## Steps
- SSH into App server 1
- Verify that the Network doesn't exist already
  ```console
  docker network ls
  ```
- Create a Docker Network with the parameters
  ```console
  docker network create -d  macvlan --subnet "172.28.0.0/24" --ip-range "172.28.0.0/24" official
  ```
- Verify it was created
- Inspect the network to confirm the configurations are correct
  ```console
  docker network inspect official
  ```


## üìù Notes
- Ensure accuracy of subnet and IP values
- You can use the `--help` for the command options
