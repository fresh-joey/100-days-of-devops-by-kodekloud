# Day 31: Git Stash

## Requirements
The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps present on Storage server in Stratos DC. One of the developers stashed some in-progress changes in this repository, but now they want to restore some of the stashed changes. Find below more details to accomplish this task:

Look for the stashed changes under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps git repository, and restore the stash with stash@{1} identifier. Further, commit and push your changes to the origin.

## Steps
- SSH into the storage server
- Change directory to the repo
- Check the list of the stashes
  ```console
  git stash list
  ```
- Restore the identified one
  ```console
  git stash apply <index>
  ```
- Commit and push
- 

## üìù Notes
- Using `apply` is safer than using `pop` with the git stash command
- You can always go back to it.
