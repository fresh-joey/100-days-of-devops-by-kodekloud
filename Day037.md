# Day 37: Copy File to Docker Container

## Requirements
The Nautilus DevOps team possesses confidential data on App Server 3 in the Stratos Datacenter. A container named `ubuntu_latest` is running on the same server.

Copy an encrypted file `/tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg` from the docker host to the `ubuntu_latest` container located at `/opt/`. Ensure the file is not modified during this operation.

## Steps
- SSH into App server 3
- Copy local file to container
  ```console
  docker cp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg ubuntu_latest:/opt/
  ```
- Get into the container and verify the file is there
  ```console
  docker exec -it ubuntu_latest bash
  ```
- The file exists

## üìù Notes
- You don't have to remember the exact command to copy
- `docker cp` will show the syntax to use to copy in either direction
