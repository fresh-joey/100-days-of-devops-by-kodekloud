# Day 46: Deploy an App on Docker Containers

## Requirements
The Nautilus Application development team recently finished development of one of the apps that they want to deploy on a containerized platform. The Nautilus Application development and DevOps teams met to discuss some of the basic pre-requisites and requirements to complete the deployment. The team wants to test the deployment on one of the app servers before going live and set up a complete containerized stack using a docker compose fie. Below are the details of the task:


On App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter create a docker compose file /opt/security/docker-compose.yml (should be named exactly).

The compose should deploy two services (web and DB), and each service should deploy a container as per details below:

`For web service:`

a. Container name must be php_web.

b. Use image php with any apache tag. Check here for more details.

c. Map php_web container's port 80 with host port 5000

d. Map php_web container's /var/www/html volume with host volume /var/www/html.


`For DB service:`

a. Container name must be mysql_web.

b. Use image mariadb with any tag (preferably latest). Check here for more details.

c. Map mysql_web container's port 3306 with host port 3306

d. Map mysql_web container's /var/lib/mysql volume with host volume /var/lib/mysql.

e. Set MYSQL_DATABASE=database_web and use any custom user ( except root ) with some complex password for DB connections.

After running docker-compose up you can access the app with curl command curl <server-ip or hostname>:5000/

For more details check here.

Note: Once you click on FINISH button, all currently running/stopped containers will be destroyed and stack will be deployed again using your compose file.

## Steps
- SSH into App server 2
- Create `docker-compose.yml` file inside the required folder and put the content below
  ```ini
  services:
  web:
    image: php:8.2-apache
    container_name: php_web
    ports:
      - "5000:80"
    volumes:
      - /var/www/html:/var/www/html

  DB:
    image: mariadb:latest
    container_name: mysql_web
    environment:
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=database_web
      - MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD="P@$$w0rd"
      - MYSQL_USER=db-user
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD="*P@$$w0rd/2025"
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    volumes:
      - /var/lib/mysql:/var/lib/mysql
  ```
- Run container from the compose file
  ```console
  docker compose up -d
  ```
- Check if the containers are running
  ```console
  docker ps -a
  ```
  

## üìù Notes
- Ensure that the database environment exists
- Specify a root password for the database, or else it will fail to initialise
- Check for syntax errors after writing the file
