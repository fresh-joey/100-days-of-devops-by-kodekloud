# Day 32: Git Rebase

## Requirements
The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/beta.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:

One of the developers is working on feature branch and their work is still in progress, however there are some changes which have been pushed into the master branch, the developer now wants to rebase the feature branch with the master branch without loosing any data from the feature branch, also they don't want to add any merge commit by simply merging the master branch into the feature branch. Accomplish this task as per requirements mentioned.

Also remember to push your changes once done.

## Steps
- SSH into the storage server
- Switch to repo folder
- Switch to the feature branch
- Rebase the feature branch onto the latest master
  ```console
  git rebase master
  ```
- Push to remote
  ```console
  git push origin feature --force-with-lease
  ```
- 

## üìù Notes
- Rebase is useful when you don't want to merge the content of a branch into another
- It's similar to the syntax for a git merge
- We use --force-with-lease here because rebasing rewrites history.
- This lets you safely update the remote branch as long as nobody else has pushed to it since you last pulled.
- `--force-with-lease` is the crucial flag that provides a safer alternative to `--force`.
- Unlike `--force`, which blindly overwrites the remote branch with your local branch, `--force-with-lease` adds a check.
- It verifies that the remote branch's state (specifically, its last commit ID) is the same as what your local Git repository expects it to be based on your last fetch.
- If the remote branch has been updated by someone else since your last fetch, the push will fail, preventing you from accidentally overwriting their work. You would then need to fetch the latest changes and potentially rebase or merge before attempting to push again.
- In essence, git push origin feature `--force-with-lease` ensures that you only force push if no other changes have been introduced to the remote feature branch since your last interaction with it, thereby minimising the risk of losing collaborators' work.
