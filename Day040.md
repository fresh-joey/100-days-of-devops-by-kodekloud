# Day 40: Docker EXEC Operations

## Requirements
One of the Nautilus DevOps team members was working to configure services on a kkloud container that is running on App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter. Due to some personal work he is on PTO for the rest of the week, but we need to finish his pending work ASAP. Please complete the remaining work as per details given below:

a. Install apache2 in kkloud container using apt that is running on App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter.

b. Configure Apache to listen on port 5003 instead of default http port. Do not bind it to listen on specific IP or hostname only, i.e it should listen on localhost, 127.0.0.1, container ip, etc.

c. Make sure Apache service is up and running inside the container. Keep the container in running state at the end.

## Steps
- SSH into App server 3
- Check the running containers
- Log in to the container to install Apache
  ```console
  docker exec -it kkloud bash
  apt install apache2
  ```
- Check the status of Apache
  ```console
  service apache2 status
  ```
- Edit the `ports.conf` and `000-default.conf` files to configure the default port and virtual host configuration, respectively
- Restart Apache and check the status again
  ```console
  service apache2 restart
  ```
- Test connection to the container
  ```console
  curl <contianer-ip>:5003
  ```

## üìù Notes
- The Apache service must be running after the configuration
- You can install a text editor of your choice to edit the files
- Inspect the container to get the IP address
