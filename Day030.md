# Day 30: Git hard reset

## Requirements
The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce present on Storage server in Stratos DC. This was just a test repository and one of the developers just pushed a couple of changes for testing, but now they want to clean this repository along with the commit history/work tree, so they want to point back the HEAD and the branch itself to a commit with message add data.txt file. Find below more details:

In /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce git repository, reset the git commit history so that there are only two commits in the commit history i.e initial commit and add data.txt file.

Also make sure to push your changes.

## Steps
- SSH into the storage server
- Check the git log to get the hash of the commit to reset to
- Reset Git Head
  ```console
  git reset --hard <commit sahs>
  ```
- Push changes to remote
  ```console
  git push origin master --force
  ```

## üìù Notes
- When pushing changes to remote, use the `--force` option
- If you don't git will tell you to pull before you can push, and it will undo the reset you did.
- It will ensure that the history is rewritten to the local version
- Use the option carefully
