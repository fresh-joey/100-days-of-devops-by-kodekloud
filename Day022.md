# Day 22: Clone Git Repository on Storage Server

## Requirements
The DevOps team established a new Git repository last week, which remains unused at present. However, the Nautilus application development team now requires a copy of this repository on the Storage Server in the Stratos DC. Follow the provided details to clone the repository:

The repository to be cloned is located at /opt/apps.git

Clone this Git repository to the /usr/src/kodekloudrepos directory. Ensure no modifications are made to the repository during the cloning process.

## Steps
- SSH into the storage server
- Change to the directory where you want to clone the folder
- Clone the repository
  ```console
  git clone
  ```

## üìù Notes
- It's a simple git clone
- You don't have to over think it
- Just basically the same way when you want to clone a remote repo.
